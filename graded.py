# PROBLEM1
# Create a class Dog.
# Make sure it has the attributes name, breed, color, gender.
# Create a function that will print all attributes of the class.
# Create an object of Dog in your problem1 function and print all of it's attributes.

# If the user doesn't enter the equal sign, ask them to input another string.

# Problem3
# In your main file create three Person objects.
# Change the weight and height of each one. Afterwards,
# print the BMI (body mass index) of each Person.
# If you donâ€™t know how to calculate BMI, look at the code I provided for you.

# Problem4
# Create a class Product that represents a product sold online.
# A product has a name, price, and quantity.
# The class should have changeProduct:
# a) If changeProduct has one parameter, it can change the name of the product.
# b) If changeProduct has two parameters it can change the name and price of the product.
# c) If changeProduct has three parameters it can change the name, price, and quantity of the product.
# Create an object of Product in your problem4 function and print all of it's attributes.
